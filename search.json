My book project, Minority Party Misery was\r\npublished earlier this year by University of Michigan Press. My\r\npublished work has also appeared in academic journals such as\r\nPolitics, Groups, and Identities and Policy Studies\r\nJournal. Currently, I am working on a project on turnout in midterm\r\nelections with John Aldrich. My research with Jonathan Spiegler and\r\nAidan Floyd on the electoral consequences of the appointment of elected\r\nofficials to the U.S. Cabinet is forthcoming from the Journal of\r\nPolicy History. My second book, Waves of Discontent: Electoral\r\nVolatility, Public Policymaking, and the Health of American\r\nDemocracy is under advance contract with University of Michigan\r\nPress and my initial draft will be submitted to the Press this\r\ncoming semester.\r\nBook \r\nMinority\r\nParty Misery: Political Powerlessness and Electoral\r\nDisengagement. 2021. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan\r\nPress.\r\nAbstract: This book examines the role of minority\r\nparty status on politicians’ engagement in electoral politics. Jacob\r\nSmith argues that politicians are more likely to be engaged in electoral\r\npolitics when they expect their party to be in the majority in Congress\r\nafter the next election and less likely when they anticipate their party\r\nwill be in the minority. This effect is particularly likely to hold true\r\nin recent decades where parties disagree on a substantial number of\r\nissues. Politicians whose party will be in the majority have a clear\r\nincentive to engage in electoral politics because their preferred\r\npolicies have a credible chance of passing if they are in the majority.\r\nIn contrast, it is generally difficult for minority party lawmakers to\r\nget a hearing on—much less advance—their preferred policies,\r\nparticularly when institutional rules inside Congress favor the majority\r\nparty. Instead, minority party lawmakers spend most of their time\r\nfighting losing battles against policy proposals from the majority\r\nparty. Minority Party Misery examines the consequences of the\r\npowerlessness that politicians feel from continually losing battles to\r\nthe majority party in Congress. Its findings have important consequences\r\nfor democratic governance, as highly qualified minority party\r\npoliticians may choose to leave office due to their dismal circumstances\r\nrather than continue to serve until their party eventually reenters the\r\nmajority.\r\nRecent Journal Articles\r\n“Just\r\nas electable: Black Democratic candidates in swing districts.” 2020.\r\nPolitics, Groups, and Identities Available Online First.\r\nAbstract: Considerable debate exists in the\r\nliterature about whether white voters are willing to support Black\r\ncandidates for office, particularly in electorally competitive,\r\nnon-majority minority districts. This paper leverages the 2018\r\ncongressional election – which saw six Black Democratic candidates win\r\nelectorally competitive, majority white congressional districts – to\r\ncontribute to this debate. Controlling for an array of congressional\r\ndistrict-specific factors, I find that Black candidates performed no\r\nworse than white candidates did in swing seats. These results suggest\r\nthat worries from party leaders that Black candidates cannot win in\r\nmajority white swing districts may be overblown.\r\n“Explaining\r\nGun Deaths: Gun Control, Mental Illness, and Policymaking in the\r\nAmerican States.” (with Jonathan Spiegler) 2020. Policy Studies\r\nJournal 48(1):235-256.\r\nAbstract: Seeking to test two commonly proposed\r\nsolutions to gun deaths in the United States, we examine the extent to\r\nwhich (1) tougher gun control laws, (2) greater access to mental health\r\nservices, and (3) a combination of both approaches affect the rate of\r\ngun deaths in American states. We find that tougher gun control laws, as\r\nwell as a combination of both approaches, are associated with a lower\r\noverall rate of gun deaths, and with a lower rate of nonsuicide gun\r\ndeaths, while only tougher gun control laws are significantly associated\r\nwith a reduction in the rate of gun‐related suicides. Our findings serve\r\nas an initial guide to policymakers seeking to reduce the rate of gun\r\ndeaths in their states.\r\nConnecting Research to Teaching\r\nJonathan Spiegler and I contributed a case study to SAGE’s\r\nResearch Methods Cases entitled “Regression\r\nAnalysis for Beginners: Exploring Gun Violence” based upon our\r\nresearch for the PSJ article. In this case study, we introduce the\r\nintroductory undergraduate student to OLS regression through the window\r\nof the analysis we conducted for this paper.\r\nPreviously, I wrote another SAGE\r\ncase study on my and Neil Weinberg’s 2016 American\r\nPolitics Research paper on the electoral effect of former North\r\nCarolina Commissioner of Labor Cherie Berry’s elevator pictures. This\r\ncase study was designed to introduce the advanced undergraduate students\r\nto spatial modeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nMy teaching interests within American politics include elections,\r\nCongress, political polarization, the presidency, and public opinion. I\r\nalso enjoy teaching classes focused on on public policy, undergraduate\r\nresearch methods, and academic writing.\r\nDuring the 2022-23 school year, I was a visiting assistant professor\r\nat Kenyon College. Previously, I taught at Duke University, offering\r\ncourses in in the Departments of Statistical Science and Political Science and in the Thompson Writing Program. I have also\r\ntaught courses in the UNC Political Science\r\nDepartment and the MPA@UNC\r\nprogram.\r\nMy classes are usually a mix of short lectures intertwined with other\r\nmodes of learning, such as class-wide discussions, simulations, and\r\nactivities that emphasize specific skills. I design my lectures to not\r\nbe a one-sided conversation, but rather promote critical thought and\r\nprovoke responses from students. I also incorporate active learning into\r\nmy classes with simulations and discussions.\r\nAs I finalize my syllabi for this Fall, I will upload syllabi here as\r\na resource for Fordham students.\r\nAs a guide of how I teach, here are sample syllabi from two of the\r\ncourses I taught at Duke:\r\nStatistics\r\n101: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference Introduction\r\nto statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. Themes\r\ninclude data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling.\r\nFocus on principles underlying quantitative research in social sciences,\r\nhumanities, and public policy. Research projects teach the process of\r\nscientific discovery and synthesis and critical evaluation of research\r\nand statistical arguments. Readings give perspective on why in 1950, S.\r\nWilks said, “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a\r\nqualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and\r\nwrite.”\r\nWriting\r\n101: Congress and Quantitative Writing The American people\r\nwidely view Congress to be a dysfunctional institution, with a 2013\r\nPublic Policy Polling poll rating Congress as less popular than\r\ncockroaches, root canals, and the band Nickelback. Yet despite this\r\nunpopularity, most members of Congress who seek reelection continue to\r\nwin. In this course, we will look at how scholars explain puzzles about\r\nCongress such as this through writings including theoretical essays,\r\ndescriptive analyses, and quantitative research articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
