Previously, I was a Lecturing Fellow in the Thompson Writing Program at Duke from 2018-2020. Before that, I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from UNC-Chapel Hill in 2018, focusing on American Politics, Research Methods, and Public Policy.\nMy research and teaching interests center on legislative politics, elections, state politics and policy, research methods, and academic writing. I am especially interested in quantitative writing pedagogy. In his spare time, I enjoy watching British and Scandinavian detective shows, running, and following elections.\n\n\n\n",

My book project, Minority Party Misery was published earlier this year by University of Michigan Press. My published work has also appeared in academic journals such as Politics, Groups, and Identities and Policy Studies Journal. Currently, I am working on a project on turnout in midterm elections with John Aldrich, a paper on the electoral consequences of the appointment of elected officials to the U.S. Cabinet with Jonathan Spiegler and Aidan Floyd, and a single-authored study of how minority party status affects female and Black legislators’ retirement decisions.\nBook Project\nMinority Party Misery: Political Powerlessness and Electoral Disengagement\nAbstract: This book examines the role of minority party status on politicians’ engagement in electoral politics. Jacob Smith argues that politicians are more likely to be engaged in electoral politics when they expect their party to be in the majority in Congress after the next election and less likely when they anticipate their party will be in the minority. This effect is particularly likely to hold true in recent decades where parties disagree on a substantial number of issues. Politicians whose party will be in the majority have a clear incentive to engage in electoral politics because their preferred policies have a credible chance of passing if they are in the majority. In contrast, it is generally difficult for minority party lawmakers to get a hearing on—much less advance—their preferred policies, particularly when institutional rules inside Congress favor the majority party. Instead, minority party lawmakers spend most of their time fighting losing battles against policy proposals from the majority party. Minority Party Misery examines the consequences of the powerlessness that politicians feel from continually losing battles to the majority party in Congress. Its findings have important consequences for democratic governance, as highly qualified minority party politicians may choose to leave office due to their dismal circumstances rather than continue to serve until their party eventually reenters the majority.\nRecent Journal Articles\n“Just as electable: Black Democratic candidates in swing districts.” 2020. Politics, Groups, and Identities Available Online First.\nAbstract: Considerable debate exists in the literature about whether white voters are willing to support Black candidates for office, particularly in electorally competitive, non-majority minority districts. This paper leverages the 2018 congressional election – which saw six Black Democratic candidates win electorally competitive, majority white congressional districts – to contribute to this debate. Controlling for an array of congressional district-specific factors, I find that Black candidates performed no worse than white candidates did in swing seats. These results suggest that worries from party leaders that Black candidates cannot win in majority white swing districts may be overblown.\n“Explaining Gun Deaths: Gun Control, Mental Illness, and Policymaking in the American States.” (with Jonathan Spiegler) 2020. Policy Studies Journal 48(1):235-256.\nAbstract: Seeking to test two commonly proposed solutions to gun deaths in the United States, we examine the extent to which (1) tougher gun control laws, (2) greater access to mental health services, and (3) a combination of both approaches affect the rate of gun deaths in American states. We find that tougher gun control laws, as well as a combination of both approaches, are associated with a lower overall rate of gun deaths, and with a lower rate of nonsuicide gun deaths, while only tougher gun control laws are significantly associated with a reduction in the rate of gun‐related suicides. Our findings serve as an initial guide to policymakers seeking to reduce the rate of gun deaths in their states.\nConnecting Research to Teaching\nJon Spiegler and I contributed a case study to SAGE’s Research Methods Cases entitled “Regression Analysis for Beginners: Exploring Gun Violence” based upon our research for the PSJ article. In this case study, we introduce the introductory undergraduate student to OLS regression through the window of the analysis we conducted for this paper.\nPreviously, I wrote another SAGE case study on my and Neil Weinberg’s 2016 American Politics Research paper on the electoral effect of former North Carolina Commissioner of Labor Cherie Berry’s elevator pictures. This case study was designed to introduce the advanced undergraduate students to spatial modeling.\n\n\n\n",

Currently, I am an Assistant Research Professor in the Departments of Statistical Science and Political Science at Duke University. This coming semester I am teaching STA101: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference and STA199: Introduction to Data Science and Statistical Thinking. In the Spring, in addition to my statistics classes, I will be teaching POLI 116: The American Political System in the Political Science Department.\nPreviously, I taught courses in the Thompson Writing Program at Duke, and the UNC Political Science Department and the MPA@UNC program. Teaching is incredibly rewarding because it allows me to channel my expertise into guiding students’ educational journey. My classes are usually a mix of short lectures intertwined with other modes of learning, such as class-wide discussions, simulations, and activities that emphasize specific skills. I design my lectures to not be a one-sided conversation, but rather promote critical thought and provoke responses from students. I also incorporate active learning into my classes with simulations and discussions.\nHere are sample syllabi from two of the courses I have taught:\nStatistics 101: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference Introduction to statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. Themes include data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling. Focus on principles underlying quantitative research in social sciences, humanities, and public policy. Research projects teach the process of scientific discovery and synthesis and critical evaluation of research and statistical arguments. Readings give perspective on why in 1950, S. Wilks said, “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.”\nWriting 101 Congress and Quantitative Writing The American people widely view Congress to be a dysfunctional institution, with a 2013 Public Policy Polling poll rating Congress as less popular than cockroaches, root canals, and the band Nickelback. Yet despite this unpopularity, most members of Congress who seek reelection continue to win. In this course, we will look at how scholars explain puzzles about Congress such as this through writings including theoretical essays, descriptive analyses, and quantitative research articles.\n\n\n\n",
